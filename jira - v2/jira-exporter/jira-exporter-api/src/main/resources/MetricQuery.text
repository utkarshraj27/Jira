MetricQuery: 
---------------------------------------
1: Mean Time To Deploy - Done
Jira Query - 

project=ESDN AND
issuetype in (standardIssueTypes(), subTaskIssueTypes()) AND
status in (Done, Resolved, Closed) AND
fixVersion in releasedVersions()
* There are many issues, where creation date is after their fix version's release date. 
* Prune such issues 
The calculated Mean Time to Deploy from this dataset is X days per ticket for Y number valid tickets.
-----------------------------------------
2. Effort per Release - Pending
Jira Query - 

project = ESDN AND
fixVersion = <version>

avg(avg(aggregateeffort of ticket for a release)) 


------------------------------------------
3. Customer Ticket Volume - Done

JIRA Query - 

project = ESDN AND
created >= -30d

total number of issues found / 30 = X number of tickets per day in last 30 days 
-------------------------------------------
4. Change Volume - Done

JIRA Query - 

project = ESDN AND
fixVersion = <version>

find tickets per release for all releases and take an average 
Unit: number of issues per release
--------------------------------------------
5. Deployment Size - Done 

JIRA Query - 

project = ESDN AND
fixVersion = <version>

find tickets per release for all releases and take an average 


Unit: number of issues per release

Notes: Given LLA currently doesnâ€™t track ad-hoc modifications made in production, and this value only covers
new and updates features tracked in Jira and logged against releases, this is the same value as Change Volume.
